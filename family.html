            <p style="font-size: 18px"><br> As I share more about myself, it's important to acknowledge the incredible support and love I've received from my family. I come from the beautiful town of Lianga in Surigao del Sur, a place that holds a special place in my heart.<br><br>
                My parents, Edwin Yamson Sarmen and Jocelyn Alambag Sarmen , have been my pillars of strength. At 60 and 57 years old, respectively, they have provided me with unwavering support, guidance, and the values that have shaped my character and ambitions.<br><br>
                I am blessed with six siblings, each of whom adds a unique and cherished element to our family dynamic: <br><br>
                Jerwin Alambag Sarmen, who is happily married to Mylyne Perales Sarmen. They have three wonderful children: Megan Perales, the eldest; Jerz Ezekiel, the middle child; and Milia Luna Perales Sarmen, the youngest.<br><br>
                Junrey Alambag Sarmen, who shares his life with his wife, Dany May Malayan Sarmen, and they have two lovely children: Danica Jane Malayan Sarmen, the oldest, and Charlotte Dyne Malayan Sarmen, the youngest.<br><br>
                Jessery Alambag Sarmen, a sibling who has added his own unique perspective and experiences to our family.<br><br>
                Jocen Alambag Sarmen, another valuable member of our family, whose presence brings joy to our lives.<br><br>
                Jonna Mae Alambag Sarmen, a sibling with whom I've shared many memorable moments and experiences.<br><br>
                It's essential to note that our family has faced challenges, and we carry the memory of my sibling Jers Alambag Sarmen, who tragically passed away in June 2020 due to leptospirosis. His absence is deeply felt, and he remains in our hearts as a cherished member of our family.<br><br>
                My family is not just my support system; they are my source of inspiration and motivation. They have taught me the value of love, unity, and resilience, which I carry with me in all aspects of my life.<br><br>
                As I continue my educational and personal journey, I am grateful for the strong foundation my family has provided. They have instilled in me the importance of pursuing my dreams and striving for excellence.
